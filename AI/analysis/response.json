    "Prioritize replication: obtain at least several independent Shock vs Sepsis cohorts (aim for n_studies_ss \u2265 5) to confirm effect size and reduce risk of single-study bias.",
    "Perform a meta-analysis including additional SS datasets; reassess q_ss and heterogeneity (I\u00b2) once more studies are available.",
    "Validate the pair experimentally (orthogonal assays, e.g., qPCR/protein) and assess clinical confounders/stratified analyses to address potential sources of heterogeneity seen in SOTH.",
    "If limited SS data persists, treat SOTH as supportive evidence but interpret cautiously given moderate I\u00b2 and small study count; consider standardized preprocessing and sensitivity analyses."
